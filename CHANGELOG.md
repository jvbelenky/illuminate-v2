## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Point-and-click position and aim point picking for lamps (matches calcpoint interface)
- App version displayed in status bar (`illuminate v0.1.x | guv-calcs 0.7.0`)
- Dynamic "How To Cite" citation with guv-calcs version
- Playwright e2e test suite (smoke, room, lamps, zones, calculate, save/load, mobile)
- Version-tagged Docker deployments with rollback support (`bash deploy.sh rollback <version>`)
- Auto-patch-bump on deploy when no release tag exists on HEAD

### Fixed
- Calc zone editor no longer closes when switching between zone types (plane/volume/point)
- Value Display label now correctly shows "Fluence Rate" only for actual fluence calculations
- Zone update race condition from mutating `calc_zones` dict during iteration
- Zone update crashes, height tracking, and point calc_mode bugs
- `view_direction` / `view_target` mutual exclusivity conflict
- Point-and-click placement/aiming no longer opens scene objects underneath the click target
- CalcPoint3D marker uses sqrt-based scaling instead of linear, preventing oversized markers in large rooms
- Add missing `aim_x`/`aim_y`/`aim_z` fields to `SessionZoneState` and `LoadedZone` backend schemas
- Zone spacing/num_points display now always shows fresh backend values when toggling modes
- IES fixture test path now derived from installed guv_calcs package (portable across environments)

### Changed
- CI uses `--locked` for reproducible API dependency installs
- File upload tests re-enabled in CI

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-24

- Calculation volume (CalcVol) 3D visualization with isosurface rendering
- Zone statistics panel with fluence rate plots
- Session persistence via sessionStorage with auto-recovery
- Docker single-image production build
